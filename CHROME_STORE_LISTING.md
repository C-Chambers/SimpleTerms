## Permissions Justification

### Host Permissions: `<all_urls>`

**Why we need this permission:**
SimpleTerms needs to analyze privacy policies on any website you visit. Privacy policies can be hosted on any domain, and we need to:

1. **Detect privacy policy links** on the current page you're viewing
2. **Access privacy policy content** when it's on a different domain than the main site
3. **Extract text content** from privacy policy pages for analysis

This broad permission is essential because:
- Privacy policies are often hosted on third-party domains (like TrustArc, OneTrust, etc.)
- Many sites use different subdomains for their legal pages
- We can't predict which websites users will want to analyze

**User Control:**
- The extension only activates when you explicitly click "Analyze"
- No automatic scanning or background processing occurs
- You have complete control over when the extension accesses page content

**Privacy Protection:**
- We only read privacy policy content when you request it
- No browsing history is collected or tracked
- Content is only temporarily processed for analysis and immediately discarded

### Other Permissions

**activeTab**: Only accesses the current tab when you click the extension
**scripting**: Needed to extract privacy policy text from web pages
**storage**: Stores only a local count of analyses performed (no personal data)
**tabs**: Required to identify the current page for analysis
