[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0.1-green.svg)](https://github.com/C-Chambers/SimpleTerms)
[![Test Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sites%20Tested-50-blue.svg)](TESTING_WORKFLOW.md)
[![Pass Rate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pass%20Rate-98%25-brightgreen.svg)](tests/fixtures/regression-sites.json)

A browser extension that uses AI to instantly summarize complex privacy policies and assign a "Privacy Risk Score," empowering you to understand how your data is being used.

## 🎯 The Problem

Privacy policies are dense, filled with legal jargon, and designed to be difficult for the average person to understand. This creates a significant information imbalance, forcing users to agree to terms they haven't read and can't comprehend. SimpleTerms bridges this "readability gap," giving you the clarity you need to make informed decisions about your data.

## ✨ Core Features

### Free Features (MVP - Version 1.0)
- 🔍 **Automatic Policy Detection**: Scans any webpage to automatically find the link to the privacy policy
- 🖱️ **One-Click Analysis**: A single button initiates the entire analysis process
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Summaries**: Generates 7 key bullet points covering:
  - What personal data is collected
  - How that data is used
  - Whether your data is shared with or sold to third parties
- 🎯 **Privacy Risk Score**: 1-10 scale assessment of privacy risk level
- ✅ **Tested on 50 Major Websites**: Verified compatibility with 98% success rate (49/50 sites)

### Premium Features (Planned)
- 🔔 **Policy Change Monitoring**: Get alerts when websites update their privacy policies
- 📊 **Detailed Risk Breakdown**: Category-specific risk assessments
- ♾️ **Unlimited Summaries**: No daily limits
