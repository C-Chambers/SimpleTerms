Complete Breakdown: AI-Powered Privacy Policy Summarizer (Browser Extension)
This document provides a comprehensive plan for developing, launching, and monetizing a browser extension that simplifies complex privacy policies for everyday internet users.

1. Project Vision & Core Problem
Vision: To empower internet users with a clear and immediate understanding of how their data is being used by websites, bridging the "readability gap" between dense legal documents and the user's right to be informed.

Core Problem: Privacy policies are intentionally complex, lengthy, and filled with legal jargon, making them inaccessible to the average user. This forces users to consent to terms they don't understand, creating a significant information imbalance.   

2. Solution & Value Proposition
The Product: A lightweight browser extension that, with a single click, analyzes a website's privacy policy and presents a concise, easy-to-understand summary.

Unique Selling Proposition (USP): The extension will not only summarize but also critique the policy, providing an AI-generated "Privacy Risk Score." This transforms the tool from a simple summarizer into an actionable "privacy watchdog," giving users an at-a-glance assessment of whether they should be concerned.

3. Target Audience
The "privacy-curious" internet user. This demographic is aware of and concerned about data privacy but lacks the technical or legal expertise to decipher complex policies. They value tools that provide clarity and peace of mind without a steep learning curve.

4. Core Feature Set (Minimum Viable Product)
Automatic Policy Detection: The extension's content script will scan the active webpage to automatically find the link to the privacy policy, using regular expressions to identify common URL patterns (e.g., /privacy-policy, /terms, /legal).   

One-Click Summarization: The user interface will feature a single, prominent button to initiate the analysis.

AI-Powered Summary: The core of the MVP. The AI will generate a simple, bulleted summary focusing on three critical areas as required by platforms like the Chrome Web Store :   

What personal data is collected (e.g., name, IP address, browsing history).

How that data is used.

Whether the data is shared with or sold to third parties.

5. Advanced Features & Monetization Path
The long-term business model relies on evolving from a free utility to a premium service.   

AI-Powered Privacy Risk Score: A premium feature where the AI analyzes the policy for vague language, invasive clauses, or practices that deviate from industry standards, assigning a simple letter grade (A-F) or a color-coded score.

Policy Change Monitoring & Alerts: A subscription-based service that monitors the privacy policies of a user's frequently visited sites and sends an alert when a significant change is detected.

Monetization Strategy (Freemium Model):

Free Tier: Allows a limited number of summaries per month (e.g., 5-10) to demonstrate the core value.

Premium Tier: For a small monthly subscription or a one-time lifetime fee, users unlock unlimited summaries, the Privacy Risk Score, and the policy monitoring service. Payments can be handled seamlessly by integrating a service like ExtensionPay, which is designed for browser extensions and takes a small transaction fee.   

6. Technology Stack
Extension Frontend: Standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A lightweight framework is optional but not necessary for the MVP.

Backend: A serverless function (e.g., Google Cloud Functions, AWS Lambda) is crucial. This function will act as a secure proxy to handle API calls to the AI model, preventing the API key from being exposed in the client-side code of the extension.   

AI Model: A powerful large language model like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's GPT series, accessed via API call from the serverless function.

Project Manager Guide for AI Coding Assistant
Project Title: "PrivacyGuard" - AI Privacy Policy Summarizer Chrome Extension

Objective: To build, from scratch, a functional MVP of the PrivacyGuard browser extension. This guide is structured as a series of sequential prompts to be executed by an AI coding assistant.

Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Manifest Setup
Prompt 1.1: "Generate the complete file structure for a new Google Chrome extension. Include a manifest.json file, a popup/ directory containing popup.html, popup.js, and popup.css, a scripts/ directory containing content.js and background.js, and an icons/ directory with placeholders for 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel icons."

Prompt 1.2: "Populate the manifest.json file for a Manifest V3 extension. Set the name to 'PrivacyGuard' and the version to '1.0'. Define the action to use popup/popup.html as the default popup. Grant the following permissions: activeTab and scripting. Define content_scripts to run scripts/content.js on all URLs (<all_urls>)."

Phase 2: User Interface (Popup)
Prompt 2.1: "Create the HTML for popup/popup.html. It should include a main container div. Inside, add a <h1> with the text 'PrivacyGuard', a <button> with the ID analyzeButton and text 'Analyze Policy', and a div with the ID resultsContainer which will initially be empty. Link to the popup.css and popup.js files."

Prompt 2.2: "Create the CSS for popup/popup.css. Style the popup to have a fixed width of 350px. Center the content, style the analyzeButton to be prominent and visually appealing, and add a simple loading spinner animation class that can be applied to the resultsContainer."

Phase 3: Core Logic - Detecting the Privacy Policy
Prompt 3.1: "Write the JavaScript for scripts/content.js. This script needs to scan the current webpage's DOM for all <a> tags. It should then use a prioritized array of regular expressions to find the URL that is most likely the privacy policy link. The regex patterns should look for keywords like 'privacy-policy', 'privacy', 'terms', and 'legal'. Once the best-matching URL is found, the script should send this URL to the popup script using    

chrome.runtime.sendMessage."

Prompt 3.2: "Now, write the initial code for popup/popup.js. It should add an event listener to the analyzeButton. When clicked, it should first get the active tab's ID and then use chrome.scripting.executeScript to inject and run the scripts/content.js file on that tab. Add a listener for chrome.runtime.onMessage to receive the policy URL sent from the content script."

Phase 4: Backend AI Integration (Serverless Function)
Prompt 4.1: "Write a Node.js function for deployment as a Google Cloud Function. This function must be an HTTP-triggered endpoint that accepts a POST request. It should expect a JSON body with a single key: policyText. Include security best practices like CORS configuration to only allow requests from your extension's ID."

Prompt 4.2: "Inside that Google Cloud Function, integrate the Google Gemini API. The function should take the policyText from the request body and send it to the Gemini model with the following prompt: 'You are a helpful privacy assistant. First, summarize this privacy policy in no more than five simple bullet points, focusing on what personal data is collected, how it is used, and if it is shared with third parties. Second, based on the text, assign a privacy risk score from 1 (very safe) to 10 (very invasive). Return the result as a single, clean JSON object with two keys: summary (a string with markdown bullet points) and score (an integer).' Ensure proper error handling for the API call."

Phase 5: Connecting the Dots - Frontend to Backend
Prompt 5.1: "Update popup/popup.js. Inside the chrome.runtime.onMessage listener that receives the policy URL, add the following logic:

Use the fetch API to get the raw HTML content from the received policy URL.

Create a function to parse this HTML and extract only the human-readable text content, stripping out HTML tags, scripts, and styles.

Display the loading spinner in the resultsContainer.

Make a POST request to the Google Cloud Function endpoint you created in Phase 4, sending the extracted policy text in the JSON body.

Handle the JSON response from the serverless function."

Prompt 5.2: "In popup/popup.js, write the function that processes the response from the backend. It should:

Hide the loading spinner.

Clear any previous content in the resultsContainer.

Dynamically create and append a div to display the score. The text color of the score should be green if the score is 1-3, yellow for 4-6, and red for 7-10.

Dynamically create and append a <ul> element and populate it with <li> elements based on the bullet points from the summary string."

Phase 6: Monetization with ExtensionPay
Prompt 6.1: "Integrate the ExtensionPay.js library into the project. In popup/popup.js, initialize ExtensionPay with the placeholder ID 'YOUR-EXTENSION-ID'.

Prompt 6.2: "Modify the analyzeButton's event listener in popup/popup.js. Before executing the analysis, it should first call extpay.getUser(). Then, check if user.paid is true. If it is, proceed with the analysis. If user.paid is false, open the payment page by calling extpay.openPaymentPage()."

Prompt 6.3 (Freemium Logic): "Refine the logic from Prompt 6.2 to implement a freemium model. Use chrome.storage.local to store a summaryCount. Before the analysis, check the user's paid status. If not paid, check the summaryCount. If the count is less than 5, proceed with the analysis and increment the count. If the count is 5 or more, call extpay.openPaymentPage() instead of performing the analysis."
